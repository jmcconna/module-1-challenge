# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor


## Description of Exercise

This was an exercise in refactoring a website to improve a website's accessibility and readability without changing any of the appearance or functionality. I replaced non-semantic HTML elements with semantic HTML elements, which is important for accessibilty and SEO. I removed redundant CSS styling by consolidating similar properties into classes. I added some comments to help future developers understand the purposes of various sections in the HTML and CSS docs.
